# Sample Food-Ordering Website

This project showcases a mockup of a food-ordering website. While it doesn't have functional backend features, it serves as a visual representation emphasizing proficient use of HTML and CSS for design and layout purposes. 


## Overview
This summer, I embarked on a journey to learn web development technologies, and I'm excited to present my first ever responsive website. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project reflects my dedication to learning and the progress I made over a few months.
